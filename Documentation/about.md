## About Novusk

Novusk right now is a proof-of-conecpt kernel that is based off Phillip Oppermann's 
[Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) and is supposed to be a Rust equivalent of 
[Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/). Since this is written in Rust it will be slightly faster and more secure
because of Rust's safety features. For more information go to the 
[new-kernel readme](https://github.com/new-kernel/new-kernel).

## Goal

The goal is to make Novusk supported on most architectures and devices and for it to be usable for any bare metal 
project.
