# FAT

Novusk uses FAT file system and supports bootable USBs formatted with FAT 32/64. You can create files and directories 
with [LibNU](https://crates.io/crates/libnu), documentation on fs is 
[here](https://github.com/new-kernel/libnu/blob/master/src/io/fs/mod.rs#L9). LibNU documentation doesn't work on Docs 
Rs.
