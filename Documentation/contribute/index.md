# Contributing to Novusk

Rules:
1. Your code must compile without errors
2. If your code doesn't run properly you need to debug it explain how to fix it or just follow rule number 3
3. Submit working code
4. If you copy someone give credit (First name, Last name - Source)
5. Provide a small explanation and some documentation in the pull request

### Drivers

Novusk should be supported on almost everything and should be able to do pretty much the same thing as all kernels
(interact with hardware, good support for userspace, etc...), so most driver pull requests will be accepted as long as
they follow the contributing rules.

### Arch/Main Kernel

If you make a pull request for changes to the main kernel or an architecture specific kernel, your code needs to be very
clean, readable, and make a big difference to help the kernel.

### Other

Your pull request will likely be accepted because I don't care enough about the other parts of the kernel to make
specific rules for them.
