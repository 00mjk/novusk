# Compiling x86 Novusk

### Support
Novusk supports two architectures from the x86 CPU family, i686 usually used in Intel Pentium CPUs, and x86_64 usually
used in x86 AMD CPUs.

### Compiling

To compiling x86 Novusk, this is the main command:
```commandline
make all ARCH=x86 TARGET_ARCH=<arch>
```

For i686:
```commandline
make all ARCH=x86 TARGET_ARCH=i686
```

For x86_64:
```commandline
make all ARCH=x86 TARGET_ARCH=x86_64
```
